# First_Smart_Contract

* We are a startup company and we have created our own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial instituions. The team wants to build smart contracts to automate
some company finances to make everyone's life easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic. 
* I am tasked with making 3 ProfitSplitter contracts. The contracts will do several things.

### Level One
* AssociateProfitSplitter - This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees.
This will allow the Human Resource department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

### Level Two
* TieredProfitSplitter - that will distribute different percentage of incomeing Ether to employees at different tieers/levels. For Example the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25% 
and Bob get 15%.

### Level Three 
* DeferredEquityPlan - that models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years
for s single employee.
