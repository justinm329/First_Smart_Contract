# ProfitSplitter_Contract

* We are a startup company and we have created our own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial instituions. The team wants to build smart contracts to automate
some company finances to make everyone's life easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic. 
* I am tasked with making 3 ProfitSplitter contracts. The contracts will do several things.

### Level One
* AssociateProfitSplitter - This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees.
This will allow the Human Resource department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

### Level Two
* TieredProfitSplitter - This contract will distribute different percentage of incomeing Ether to employees at different tieers/levels. For Example the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25% 
and Bob get 15%.

### Level Three 
* DeferredEquityPlan - This contract models traditional company deferred equity plan. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee. If an employee only stays with the company for 2 years they will earn 500 shares, and the other 500 will go back to the company. If they leave after 5 years they will have the full 1000.
